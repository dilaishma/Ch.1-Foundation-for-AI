# Ch.1-Foundation-for-AI

I created this repository to explain my team assignment deliverables chapter 1 â€œFoundation
for Artificial Intelligence" in MSIB program at Startup Campus. 

**Assignment 1 case [2]**
In this case, the task is to create a Python program to help a bank calculate the number of each denomination of Indonesian Rupiah needed to disburse a customer's savings. The denominations include both paper money (from Rp 2,000 to Rp 100,000) and coins (from Rp 100 to Rp 1,000). The program should prioritize using the largest denominations first and must handle amounts under 1 billion Rupiah. If there is any remaining balance that cannot be disbursed with the available denominations, the program should indicate this to the user. The goal is to efficiently determine the quantity of each paper and coin denomination required for the transaction.

**Assignment 1 case [3]**
In this case, the task is to analyze an employee dataset using Python's Pandas library to answer some data questions. The EDA process will include the following visualizations to provide deeper insights: Scatter Plot to identify relationships between numerical variables, Bar Chart to compare categorical data such as termination of an employee's, Pie Chart to see the percentage of terminated employees, Boxplot to depict Salary based on Marital Desc , and Pairplot to explore the relationship between multiple features.
